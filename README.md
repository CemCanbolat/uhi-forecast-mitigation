# **AI-Powered UHI Prediction and Mitigation System**

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our AI-powered system designed to predict Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) and recommend mitigation strategies.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

This web-based tool utilizes a hybrid **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** model to analyze satellite imagery, historical weather data, and urban features. The system generates **real-time heat risk maps** and suggests **context-aware cooling measures** tailored to specific urban environments.

Urban Heat Islands are localized zones of elevated temperature in urban areas, primarily due to dense infrastructure and limited vegetation. These hotspots negatively impact **public health**, **increase energy consumption**, and reduce **urban sustainability**. Our AI system aims to **predict these zones before they fully form** and provide **intelligent mitigation recommendations**.

## 🔍 **Key Features**

- AI-driven UHI prediction using a CNN-LSTM architecture
- Context-aware mitigation strategies
- Intuitive and responsive web interface for stakeholders

## 🎯 **Objectives**

- Develop an accurate AI model for predicting UHI formation
- Integrate a decision-support module for localized mitigation strategies
- Provide a user-friendly interface for visualizing UHI risks and solutions
- Empower stakeholders with data-driven insights for climate resilience

## 🧠 **Methodology**

The core AI engine leverages:

- **CNN layers** for extracting spatial features from satellite imagery
- **LSTM layers** for capturing temporal trends in weather and heat behavior

Together, these components generate **dynamic heat risk maps**. The system then assesses urban characteristics and recommends **tailored mitigation strategies**.

## 🏙️ **Application Use Cases**

- Climate-resilient urban planning
- Environmental monitoring and research
- Public health interventions by local governments and NGOs
