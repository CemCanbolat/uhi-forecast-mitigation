                        Urban areas experience significantly higher temperatures than their rural surroundings due to factors like heat-absorbing materials, building density, and reduced vegetation, creating Urban Heat Islands (UHIs). This phenomenon, amplified by global climate change and increasing urbanization, leads to more frequent and intense heatwaves, directly impacting urban dwellers' well-being, increasing energy consumption for cooling, and posing health risks.

                        While the impact of urban redevelopment on surface temperatures is an area of study, there's a pressing need for proactive prediction of potential future Urban Hot Spots (UHS)â€”localized high-temperature areas within UHIs directly related to heat stress.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Current LST prediction models are often based on isolated station data or limited pixel-based predictions, making continuous regional-scale UHS prediction challenging. This project aims to fill this gap by developing an AI-powered system to predict UHS formation on a broader scale before they occur, identify high-risk areas, and recommend effective cooling strategies.

                            While past effects and broad future projections are studied, there's an opportunity for more dynamic, temporally sequenced UHI/UHS forecasting (e.g., 24-72 hours ahead) using AI.

                            A critical gap also exists in translating predictive insights into easily accessible and actionable mitigation recommendations for diverse urban stakeholders. Our project aims to address these by developing a predictive system with a focus on timely forecasts and actionable mitigation guidance.
